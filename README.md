The user is given an option to choose from a set of excercises. Once he clicks on them, 2 parallel windows open : one showing the seed video and the other showing the real time frame of the user performing the excercise. 
As soon as the user deviates from the excercise in the seed video - a buzzer is sounded and exact point of default is printed on the screen .
