# DoItRight

An application that compares the live video stream of your exercise routine with a sample video, and alerts the user as soon as he deviates from the ideal exercise implementation.

## Why use DoItRight 

Physiotherapy sessions, especially for chronic diseases are not covered by most insurance schemes. This is for the organised sector, for the unorganised sector, the priviledge doesn’t exist.

Unsupervised exercise implementation practised over a long time causes more injuries than accidents caused due to abrupt movements.
